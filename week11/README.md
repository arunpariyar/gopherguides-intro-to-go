## About the author
Arun Pariyar aspires to be developer but the developement world is huge and its important to find what works, what doesn't, if it clicks or its doesn't, love it or hate it. Author is in currently in this process and heavily suffering from imposter syndrome, some days more that others but he believes in the light at the end of the tunnel. This project is a journey child of exploring the Go Programming Language under the guidance of Gopher Guides Instructor Mark Bates. 

## Acknowlegments
A journey is owed to those that point the way to the true north,its so easy to feel lost. The Author owes it to the Gopher Guides team Mark Bates and Corey Lou. The Author wouldnt have made it to the finish line otherwise. 

A journey also means meeting others travelling the same route a big thanks to Naveen and Christopher for being the coolest companions to sit beside the fire in cold night and their help in making this project an achievable endeavour.
